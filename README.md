# WebProject
                                    ABSTRACT
 Electronic commerce is a kind of industry where buying and selling of a specific product is 
performed over electronic systems such as Internet. The purpose of this web page is to bring 
knowledge to students about how to design an interactive, dynamic and fully structure ecommerce 
web page using languages such as : Javascript, Html,Php, CSS for styling it and also using sql to 
build the proper database for containing the necessary information. Database is accessible from 
the websites. The structure of the webpage provides an easy and convenient way to search for 
products along with their characteristics and make an order through just a mouse click. The main 
emphasis lies in contributing with a user-friendly interface for effectively showing the desired 
view. This project also aims to enhance the culture of performing and interacting through online 
businesses as it offers a variety of products wherever and whenever you are, without costing you 
to spend time visiting physically different shops and feeling nervous about not finding the right 
one. 
1.1 Goal
Shopping has always been considered as a physical process, but nowadays online shopping is 
adapting fast among us. The goal of this project is to develop a web based interface for online 
retailers. The system aims to be easy to use and hence make the shopping experience pleasant for 
the users. The goal of this application is :
• To develop an easy way of use for web-based interface where users can search for desired 
products(bags and accessories) , view a complete description of the products and order the 
products. 
• A structured web page that provides an easy and convenient way to search for products specific 
to their needs. 
• An stylish design of the website in order to offer a user-friendly “environment” for the clients.
• Drag and Drop feature which would allow the users to add a product to or remove a product from 
the shopping cart by dragging the product in to the shopping cart or out of the shopping cart. 
• A user can have a look of the complete specification of the product along with accurate images. 1.2 Need of our website
There is a variety of commercial Online Shopping websites offering different products prepared 
to meet the shopping interests of large number of customers. These online marketplaces have 
thousands of users all around the world, which is a huge benefit compared to physical shopping 
that is only accessed by local people.Problem:
• Actual systems are defined with non-interactive environment they provide to the users. 
• The use of traditional user interfaces which make continuous post backs to the server where each 
post back requires to get an answer from the server and to refresh the entire web form to display
what it contains. This feature has a disadvantage in online businesses because it causes a delay in 
displaying the specific results.
• Use of non user -friendly interfaces that are difficult to use from clients of any age.
Solution:
•We create a non-traditional interface of webpages in order not to delay displaying results required 
by the clients. 
•We create a user-friendly interface of website in order to be easily used from all group ages. 
•We provide interactive interface through which a user can interact with different areas of web 
pages properly. 
• Provide Remove and Drop feature thereby allowing the user to add products to or remove 
products from the shopping cart by dragging the products in to or out of the shopping cart.
 The system is designed to ask the user (dialogue boxes) if he is sure about the action he will take, 
such as remove or delete items from the cart. This enhances the communication between the system 
and the user and makes the user think twice before taking an action.3.System Analysis
After carefully analyzing the requirements and functionality of the website, we have designed two 
important diagrams by the end of the analysis process . They are the ERD(entity-relationship diagram)
diagram and RS (relational schema) which are the basis for visually and logically concepting our entities 
and relationships between them.
